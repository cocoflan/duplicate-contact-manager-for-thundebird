#Information for developers willing to create an .xpi binary from the source.

== Introduction ==

Thunderbird add-ons are distributed as a single file with .XPI extension. These files are ZIP archives containing the files you can find in the "source" folder.

== Details ==

The build process _could_ be done manually by creating a ZIP file with a certain folder structure, but it's easier to use the shell script *build.sh* in the root of the SVN trunk.

In order to build the XPI file, simply go to the directory containing the file build.sh and run the script.

This will generate an output file named like this:

*duplicate-contact-manager-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-tb.xpi*

== Requirements ==

Please make sure you have the commands available in your path:

* find
* zip

== Tipp for developers using Windows ==

You might already know this, since you also handle SVN with ease. But in case you don't: In order to run shell scripts under windows, you need a shell. You can install free, open source [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].

Under cygwin, you can also install the required tools mentioned above (called "findutils" and "zip").
